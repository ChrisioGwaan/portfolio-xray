To Whom It May Concern,

I am presently engaged as a **Software Engineering Intern** at Guangdong Jianke Innovation Technology Research Institute Co. Ltd (Gdjk ITRT), a distinguished subsidiary of [Guangdong Provincial Academy of Building Research Group Co.Ltd](https://www.gdcic.net/jky/). Our subsidiary is renowned for its expertise in crafting sophisticated software systems tailored for government construction projects.

Parallel to my professional commitments, I am pursuing a **degree in Software Engineering** at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology University ([RMIT University](https://www.rmit.edu.au/)), with an anticipated graduation date in November 2024.
